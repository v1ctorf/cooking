Basic brodo vegetale
==============
A light but tasty broth for minestre, risotti, soups or for cooking fresh pasta or just have it for hangover!
This is a good recipe if you want to avoid food waste, but it is significantly enhanced if fresh ingredients are used.
You can simply cook some pasta with some of the remains of the vegetables and add a generous pinch of grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese.


Result
------
Approximately 1,5 liter of vegetable broth


Equipments
----------
+ Pot - Ninja Foodi Max Electric Multi-Cooker [OP450UK] 7,5 L 
+ Non-stick pan - Average one from Lidl


Ingredients
----------
+ 2 l of filtered cold water
+ 200 g of carrots
+ 150 g of vine tomatoes
+ 150 g of celery
+ 200 g of onions
+ 1 tsp of black peppercorn (whole)
+ 1,5 tbsp of table salt


Extra
-----
When adding any ingredient from this section, consider if it matches with the recipes you are aiming.
+ 2 bay leaves
+ Parmigiano-reggiano rinds: adds umami and it is great for risotti


Instructions
------------
* Prepare vegetables
    * Clean all vegetables.
    * Peel the carrots and cut them in thick longitudinal sections. 
    * Remove the final part of the celery as its leaves. Then, divide them in 2 or 3 parts.
    * Just halve the tomatoes. 
    * Peel the onions and cut them in 4 parts.
* On the non-stick pan, slightly toast the black peppercorns - this is useful for pre-heat the pan for the next instruction - and reserve them.
* Braise the onions
    * Place the onion pieces on a non-stick pan - without any oil! - for 4-5 minutes on a high heat. 
    * Turn the halves from time to time to avoid burning.
    * This is made separately because we want add some flavour to the onions and the broth but we want to start from a lower temperature. If it was done directly on the cooker, the cooker would warm the water before it's needed.
* Add all vegetables and the peppercorn, and the cold water into the pressure cooker
* Set mode saute/seal and temperature "high" and bring it to a boil.
* After boiling, set temperature as "mid" simmer for 1 hour, then add the salt.
* Filter the broth - removing the vegetables
* Ready!
